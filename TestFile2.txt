This is a second test file for AgntsChatUI file selection and import functionality.

Content includes information about:
- Database management
- API integrations  
- User authentication systems
- Configuration settings
- Performance optimization techniques

This file should be discoverable when users search for terms like "database", "API", "authentication", or "performance" in their chat conversations.

The new file selection feature allows users to specifically choose which files to import as data sources, rather than scanning entire directories.

This demonstrates the flexibility of the data source system in AgntsChatUI.
