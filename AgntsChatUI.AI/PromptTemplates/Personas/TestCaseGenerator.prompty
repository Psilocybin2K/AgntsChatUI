user:
Generate test cases for the following user story:

```
As a user, I want improved visual spacing and typography on the client select page so that I can more easily scan and identify clients in the grid.
```

assistant:
Scenario: Verify improved row spacing in client grid
  Given the user is on the client selection page with multiple clients displayed

  Then each row should have a height of 40px
  And there should be 8px padding between client name and client ID columns
  And the search input should have 12px margin from the grid

  Then client names should display in semi-bold font weight (600)
  And client IDs should display in regular font weight with muted color (#666666)
  And font sizes should remain unchanged from current implementation

Scenario: Test improved hover and selection visual feedback
  Given the user is on the client selection page
  When the user hovers over a client row
  Then the row background should change to light blue (#f0f8ff)
  When the user clicks to select a client row
  Then the selected row should display a 2px solid blue border (#0066cc) on the left side
  And the selection functionality should work as before

Scenario: Verify responsive behavior with visual enhancements
  Given the user is on the client selection page on different screen sizes
  When the user resizes the browser window
  Then all spacing improvements should maintain responsive breakpoints
